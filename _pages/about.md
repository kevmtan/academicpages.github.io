I am a research associate in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) at UCLA. Previously, I have worked in the labs of [Michael Tarr](http://tarrlab.org) and [Greg Siegle](http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/pican/).

Research Interests
------
Broadly, I am interested in the [default-mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) (**DMN**) and the social, affective, and spontaneous processes it subserves. 

### Overarching role(s) of the DMN
Why does DMN underlie such a [vast and disparate](http://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/default%20mode/#studies) array of functions? What cognitive and computational properties tie these functions together?

### Spatiotemporal dynamics of social & affective processing
How do DMN and other brain regions work together to create our social and emotional worlds? What feedforward, feedback, and recurrent computations facilitate these processes, and how do they progress through time?

### DMN at rest
Why is DMN so active during rest, what is it doing? Can DMN activity at rest influence the performance of DMN-related tasks? For example, can pre-stimulus DMN activity bias perceptions of threat, trustworthiness, and intelligence?

### Broader Impacts
DMN-related processes are implicated in entrenched societal issues such as prejudice, social polarization, and mental illness. DMN-related research may aid in understanding and mitigating such issues. For example, neural patterns associated with implicit biases could be identified and deactivated through [decoded neurofeedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoded_neurofeedback). 

Methods
------
To explore my research interests, I use [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), [fNIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy), and [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) in conjunction with advanced techniques in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning.

I am particularly keen on using decoded neurofeedback to manipulate social and affective processes. I am also interested in using causal modeling to elucidate the causal architecture of social and affective processes.

Code I've written for the above methods can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/kevmtan).
