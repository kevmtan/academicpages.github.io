I am a research associate in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) at UCLA. Previously, I have worked in the labs of [Michael Tarr](http://tarrlab.org) and [Greg Siegle](http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/pican/).

Research Interests
------
Broadly, I am interested in the [default-mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) (**DMN**) and the social, affective, and spontaneous processes it subserves. 

### Overarching role(s) of the DMN
Why does DMN underlie such a vast and disparate array of functions? What cognitive and computational properties tie these functions together?

### Spatiotemporal dynamics of social & affective processing
How do DMN and non-DMN brain regions work together to create social and emotional experiences? What are the feedforward, feedback, and recurrent computations that underlie such processes?

### DMN at rest
Why is DMN so active during rest, what is it really doing? Can DMN activity at rest modulate the performance of DMN-related tasks? For example, can pre-stimulus DMN activity bias perceptions of threat, trustworthiness, and intelligence?

### Broader Impacts
DMN-related processes are implicated in entrenched societal issues such as prejudice, social polarization, and mental illness. DMN-related research may aid in understanding and mitigating such issues. For example, neural patterns associated with implicit biases may be identified and deactivated through [decoded neurofeedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoded_neurofeedback). 

Methods
------
To explore my research interests, I use [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), [fNIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy), and [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) in conjunction with advanced signal processing, statistical, and machine learning techniques.

Code I've written for the above methods can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/kevmtan).
