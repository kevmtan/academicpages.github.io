I am a research associate in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) at UCLA. Previously, I have worked in the labs of [Michael Tarr](http://tarrlab.org) and [Greg Siegle](http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/pican/).

Research Interests
======
Broadly, I am interested in the [default-mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) **(DMN)** and the social, affective, and spontaneous processes it subserves. 

**Overarching role(s) of the DMN**

What cognitive and computational properties tie together the disparate functions that recruit DMN? Does DMN play overarching role(s) in cognition and brain function?

**Interactions between the DMN and other brain regions**

What are the spatiotemporal dynamics of DMN and other brain regions during social and affective processing? What are the feedforward, feedback, and recurrent computations that comprise such processing? Which brain regions are involved in each?

**DMN at rest**

Why is DMN so active during rest, what is it really doing? How does DMN activity differ across states of consciousness (e.g. mindwandering versus dreaming)? Can DMN activity at rest predict the performance of DMN-mediated tasks? Specifically, can pre-stimulus DMN activity bias subsequent socioaffective inferences (e.g. threat judgments)? 

Methods
======
To explore my research interests, I use [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), [fNIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy), and [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) in conjunction with advanced signal processing, statistical, and machine learning techniques.

Code I've written for the above methods can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/kevmtan).
