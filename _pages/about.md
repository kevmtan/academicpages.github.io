Welcome!

I am a PhD student and NSF Research Fellow in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) and [Computational Social Neuroscience Lab](http://csnlab.org) at UCLA. 

My research explores the neurocognitive bases of our social and emotional worlds. I am particularly interested in a set of brain regions called the [default network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network). To these ends, I use intracranial electrophysiology and neuroimaging techniques on humans. 

Outside of science, I am passionate about socioeconomic issues, and participate in groups such as [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) and the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org/). I am also involved in the underground dance music scene in [Los Angeles](https://www.kcet.org/shows/real-scenes/episodes/los-angeles), and previously in [Pittsburgh](http://www.electronicbeats.net/hot-mass-pittsburgh) and [Minneapolis](https://blog.thecurrent.org/2016/11/is-minneapolis-techno-having-a-renaissance).
