I am a research associate in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) at UCLA. Previously, I have worked in the labs of [Michael Tarr](http://tarrlab.org) and [Greg Siegle](http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/pican/).

Research Interests
------
Broadly, I am interested in the [default-mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) (**DMN**) and the social, affective, and spontaneous processes it subserves. 

### Overarching role(s) of the DMN
Why does DMN underlie such a disparate array of functions – what cognitive and computational properties tie them together? Does DMN play overarching role(s) in cognition and brain function?

### Spatiotemporal dynamics of social & affective processing
How do brain regions within and outside of the DMN interact with each other during social and affective processing? What are the feedforward, feedback, and recurrent computations that comprise such processing?

### DMN at rest
Why is DMN so active during rest, what is it really doing? Can DMN activity at rest predict the performance of DMN-related tasks? For example, can pre-stimulus DMN activity bias subsequent socioaffective inferences (e.g. perceptions of trust, threat, anger)? 

Methods
------
To explore my research interests, I use [fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging), [fNIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy), and [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) in conjunction with advanced signal processing, statistical, and machine learning techniques.

Code I've written for the above methods can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/kevmtan).
