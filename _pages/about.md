I am a research associate in the [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.scn.ucla.edu) at UCLA, where I investigate the neural underpinnings of social cognition and affect.

 Previously, I have worked in the labs of [Michael Tarr](http://tarrlab.org) and [Greg Siegle](http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/pican/). In my free time, I participate in the underground [dance music scene](https://www.kcet.org/shows/real-scenes/episodes/los-angeles) of Los Angeles.
